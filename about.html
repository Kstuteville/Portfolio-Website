                I'm Kaylie, an upcoming Graduate student at New York University school of engineering, where I will be exploring the intersection
                of game development and deep learning. My focus is on exploring how AI and deep learning can enhance interactivity, emotional resonance, and NPC interaction in immersive games, transforming them into adaptive systems that evolve with their players.

                Join me on this journey, as I create my thesis, Veilbound.

            <h2>About Veilbound</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                Veilbound is my signature digital project in the works, blending cinematic visuals, game design, machine learning, and interactive storytelling. 
                Veilbound is a fantasy-horror action-adventure game featuring a female exorcist, Inara, navigating a cursed kingdom plagued by spirits, demons, and forbidden rituals. With a focus on emotionally reactive AI, moral decision-making, and atmospheric storytelling, Veilbound combines cinematic combat with immersive exploration in a vertical slice designed for thesis research and portfolio presentation.
